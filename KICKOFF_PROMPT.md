# ðŸŽ¯ PORTFOLIO KICKOFF PROMPT

---

**Build me a portfolio that whispers confidence instead of shouting for attention.**

I'm a developer who ships tools with Real Utilityâ€”projects I actually use, built on time and to spec. My audience is technical founders and AI product teams who value execution velocity over flashy demos.

## Design Philosophy
**Brutalist minimalism with a soft touch.** Think Iceland's basalt cliffs meeting clean Swiss typography. Bold where it matters, quiet everywhere else. Every element should feel intentionalâ€”like a well-crafted tool that does exactly what it promises.

## Technical Values
- **Mobile-first** because that's where people actually browse
- **Accessible by default** because good design includes everyone  
- **Fast as lightning** because respect for user's time shows respect for craft
- **Smooth where it counts** â€” subtle animations that guide, never distract

## Content Strategy
- **Hero**: Large typography, auto-play video (muted), clear value prop
- **Projects**: Clean grid, GIF previews on hover, tech stacks visible
- **About**: Personal but professional, story that connects to utility
- **Links**: GitHub, LinkedIn, deployed demos â€” let the work speak

## Aesthetic Guidelines
- **Typography**: Bold sans-serif hierarchy, generous spacing, readable sizes
- **Colors**: High contrast, Iceland-inspired palette, accent blue
- **Layout**: Asymmetrical but balanced, generous whitespace, sharp sections  
- **Motion**: Lenis smooth scroll, gentle hovers, respect reduced-motion preferences

## The KISS Test
If a feature doesn't directly help someone understand my work or contact me, cut it. Every interaction should feel naturalâ€”like picking up a well-designed tool for the first time.

**Build something that makes technical people nod with approval, not gasp with surprise.**
