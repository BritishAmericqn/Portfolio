🧠 PORTFOLIO SITE: CURSOR BRAINLIFT
==============================

📅 Deadline: 2025-07-28 — Due by 10PM CT Today
Goal: Build a high-impact portfolio site that signals professional quality, real utility, and personal style to hiring partners.

----------------------------------------
🔍 STRATEGIC FOUNDATION
----------------------------------------

✨ PERSONAL EDGE
- I develop fleshed out projects on time, within scope, and to spec.
- I build tooling optimized for both enterprise and solo workflows.

🧵 PROJECT THROUGHLINE
- All my projects are built for *Real Utility* — tools I actually use.
- I value usability, meaningful design, and tools that do serious work.

🛠️ DESIGN / DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY
- I build to the sophistication expected of production-grade software.
- I prioritize aggressively — what ships matters more than perfection.
- I execute cleanly within scope, cutting ruthlessly when needed.

🎯 AUDIENCE TARGET
- Technical founders
- AI product teams
- People who value fullstack AI fluency and execution velocity

----------------------------------------
🛠️ DEV TOOLING + FRAMEWORKS
----------------------------------------

Framework:        Next.js (or Astro for faster builds)
Styling:          Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
Components:       shadcn/ui or Radix UI for primitives
Deploy:           Vercel (GitHub connected)
Video Hosting:    YouTube (or Loom, fallback)
Design Notes:     Minimalist, modern, clean—but with pop
Color Palette:    Iceland beach / basalt + clean whites / accent color
Font:             Clean, modern (Sora, Inter, or Manrope)

Cursor Usage:
- You will be editing a project structure that includes:
  - `projects.json` (project metadata)
  - `components/ProjectCard.tsx`
  - `pages/index.tsx` for homepage / grid
  - Optional: `pages/projects/[slug].tsx` for individual pages

AI Output Goals:
- Can help fill in:
  - Project blurbs
  - Taglines
  - Video descriptions
  - About Me prose
  - Section headlines

----------------------------------------
🧩 UI/UX STRATEGY
----------------------------------------

🏞️ HERO SECTION
- Large, cinematic background (Iceland/beach/basalt aesthetic)
- One-liner summary of philosophy
- Buttons: View Projects, About Me, Resume, LinkedIn

🌀 INTERACTIVE GIMMICKS
- Scroll-triggered animations (Framer Motion)
- Timeline-based career/project growth scroll
- Code toggle ("Show me code" reveals real examples)
- Dev/Reflection mode toggle (switch between product view + behind-the-scenes)
- AI log linkouts (AutoBrainlift summaries embedded per project)
- Stack tag hovers (show tools used and confidence)

🧠 AI-LITE FEATURE IDEAS (Optional)
- “Summarize This Project” button with GPT-4 summary
- “Ask Me Anything” preloaded Q&A window

----------------------------------------
📦 PROJECT CONTENT STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------

Each project includes:
- ✅ Name
- ✅ Short description
- ✅ 3–5 highlight bullets
- ✅ GitHub link
- ✅ Deployed link (if available)
- ✅ Video walkthrough (target: 90–120 sec)
- ✅ Tags: tech stack, role

JSON structure for each project:
{
  "title": "Project Title",
  "description": "Short pitch",
  "tech": ["Tech", "Used", "Here"],
  "github": "https://github.com/...",
  "live": "https://project-demo.vercel.app",
  "video": "https://youtube.com/...",
  "role": "Your role",
  "highlights": [
    "Major highlight 1",
    "Major highlight 2",
    "Major highlight 3"
  ]
}

----------------------------------------
📝 PRE-WORK TASK CHECKLIST
----------------------------------------

[ ] Finalize project blurbs
[ ] Pick video format + re-record with new script (90s)
[ ] Define site layout (grid / scroll / detail views)
[ ] Select fonts + colors in Tailwind config
[ ] Create visual assets: screen recordings, thumbnails
[ ] Integrate hover/scroll animations

----------------------------------------
🔥 FINAL TIPS
----------------------------------------

- Clarity > Quantity: 5 clean projects > 8 noisy ones
- Motion matters: subtle animation = perceived polish
- Text hierarchy: font sizes & spacing elevate design
- Show how you think: link to reflections or planning notes
- Don’t just show what it is → show *why it matters*

Ready to build? Just feed this context into Cursor’s memory panel and let it assist with layout population, content generation, and polish!
