# Benjamin Royston | Portfolio

A brutalist minimalist portfolio that whispers confidence instead of shouting for attention.

## Philosophy

Built for technical founders and AI product teams who value execution velocity over flashy demos. Every element feels intentional—like a well-crafted tool that does exactly what it promises.

## Design Principles

- **Brutalist minimalism with a soft touch** - Iceland's basalt cliffs meeting clean Swiss typography
- **Mobile-first** because that's where people actually browse  
- **Accessible by default** because good design includes everyone
- **Fast as lightning** because respect for user's time shows respect for craft
- **Smooth where it counts** — subtle animations that guide, never distract

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for micro-interactions
- **Lenis** for smooth scrolling
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliant accessibility

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Content Updates

Replace placeholder content in:

- `src/data/projects.json` - Your actual projects
- `public/assets/` - Add your media files:
  - `hero-video.mp4` - 30-45 second showcase video
  - `profile-photo.jpg` - Professional headshot
  - `*-demo.gif` - 2-3 second project demos
- Update social links throughout components

## Performance Targets

- ✅ Lighthouse score >90 across all metrics
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design  
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ <2 second load times
- ✅ Zero console errors

## The KISS Test

"If a feature doesn't directly help someone understand my work or contact me, cut it."

Built to make technical people nod with approval, not gasp with surprise.
